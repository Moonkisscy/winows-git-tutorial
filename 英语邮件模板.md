Dear Mr./Mrs.: ________（Author name） I am a graduate student of Nanjing Agricultural University in China. I major in “animal science”（您的专业）. Recently, I found one of your articles, titled “__________” （文章名）in animal science. I found it may help me achieve my goals in this research field. This would make a really positive contribution to my work. I would like to be able to read the full text of this article. The abstract makes the article sound very interesting. I know there is usually a fee required to obtain the full article from Medline; however, as a student, my only income is a small scholarship which is about U S $30.00 per month. I wonder if you would consider sending me the full text by Email. Perhaps you would consider this as an act of friendship between our two countries. Thank you for your kind consideration of this request. Sincerely: （您的名字） My Email address is: （你的email地址） 日期：月/日/年
